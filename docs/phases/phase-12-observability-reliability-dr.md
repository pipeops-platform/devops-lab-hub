# Phase 12 — Observability, Reliability, and Disaster Recovery

## Objective

Operate the platform with end-to-end visibility, reliability targets, and recovery procedures.

## Scope

- Metrics, logs, traces
- SLI/SLO and alerting
- Backup/restore and DR validation

## Steps

1. Deploy metrics stack (Prometheus + Grafana).
2. Add centralized logging stack.
3. Add distributed tracing where applicable.
4. Define service SLI/SLO and alert thresholds.
5. Implement backup and restore playbooks.
6. Run rollback and disaster recovery drills.

## Deliverables

- Unified observability baseline
- Recovery procedures with tested outcomes

## Definition of Done (DoD)

Platform health is measurable in real time and recovery procedures are validated through periodic drills.
